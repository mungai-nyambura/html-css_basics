    <p>
        CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is the code that styles web content. 
        CSS basics walks through what you need to get started. 
        We'll answer questions like: How do I make text red?
        How do I make content display at a certain location in the (webpage) layout? 
        How do I decorate my webpage with background images and colors?
    </p>
    <h2 class="underline">What is CSS?</h2>
    <p>
        Like HTML, CSS is not a programming language. 
        It's not a markup language either. 
        <strong> CSS is a style sheet language.</strong> 
        CSS is what you use to selectively style HTML elements. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Let's try it out! Using a text editor, paste the three lines of CSS (above) into a new file. 
        Save the file as style.css in a directory named styles.
    </p>
    <p>
        To make the code work, we still need to apply this CSS (above) to your HTML document. 
        Otherwise, the styling won't change the appearance of the HTML.

    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Open your index.html file. Paste the following line in the head (between the <head> and </head> tags):</li>
        <li>Save index.html and load it in your browser. You should see something like this:</li>
    </ol>
    <img src="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/CSS_basics/website-screenshot-styled.png" 
        alt="A mozilla logo and some paragraphs. The paragraph text has been styled red by our css." 
        width="500" height="700">
        <p>
            If your paragraph text is red, congratulations! Your CSS is working.
        </p>
    <h2>Anatomy of a CSS ruleset</h2>
    <p>
        Let's dissect the CSS code for red paragraph text to understand how it works :</p>
        <img src="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/CSS_basics/css-declaration-small.png" 
        alt="CSS p declaration color red" 
        width="700" height="400" >
        
    
    <p>
        The whole structure is called a <strong>ruleset</strong>. 
        (The term ruleset is often referred to as just rule.) 
        Note the names of the individual parts:
    </p>
    <h4>Selector</h4>
    <p>
        This is the HTML element name at the start of the ruleset. 
        It defines the element(s) to be styled (in this example, <p> elements). 
        To style a different element, change the selector.
    </p>
    <h4>Declaration</h4>
    <p>
        This is a single rule like color: red;. It specifies which of the element's properties you want to style.
    </p>
    <h4>Properties</h4>
    <p>
        These are ways in which you can style an HTML element. 
        (In this example, color is a property of the <p> elements.) 
        In CSS, you choose which properties you want to affect in the rule.
    </p>
    <h4>Property value</h4>
    <p>
        To the right of the property—after the colon—there is the property value. This chooses one out of many possible appearances for a given property. (For example, there are many color values in addition to red.)
    </p>
    <p>
        Note the other important parts of the syntax:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Apart from the selector, each ruleset must be wrapped in curly braces. ({})</li>
        <li>Within each declaration, you must use a colon (:) to separate the property from its value or values.</li>
        <li>Within each ruleset, you must use a semicolon (;) to separate each declaration from the next one.</li>
    </ul>
